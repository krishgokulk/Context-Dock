# 00 — Now: the work order and the owner's decisions

> **Why this file exists:** long chat sessions get compacted and forget. Anything decided or
> queued in a chat is written here the same day, so no session — cloud, Mac, Remote Control, the
> 11:00 daily brief — depends on remembering a conversation.
> **Rules:** one task is *In progress* at a time (finish it before the next — `AGENTS.md`).
> When a task merges, move it to *Done* with its PR number and promote the next one. Decisions are
> append-only: never edit an old one, add a new dated line that replaces it.
> GitHub Issues (milestone `1.0`) remain the long backlog; this file is the next few steps.

## In progress

*None.* Task 4 (Safari tabs, D13) is done in #89; task 4b is next.

## Next, in order

**4b. Pins in the Corner strip** (owner 2026-09-25, after 4 merges). The Corner's context dock uses
the strip beside the input for things the user pins, per app: tabs, menu commands, app actions
(Safari: Add to Bookmarks, Export as PDF, Save as Markdown, Ask AI), and the user's own actions.

```
Task 4b: pins in the Corner strip. Own worktree from origin/general-chat-agent, after #89 merges.
- Any row in the Corner's app list (menu command, app action, extension, the user's own action) and any tab can be
  pinned for that app; pins show in the strip beside the input, before live tabs, and run with one click / ↩.
- Reuse the Dock's pin store (DockPinStore, inventory F4) — per-app pins, same storage; no second store.
- Safari actions: first check which of Add to Bookmarks / Export as PDF / Save as Markdown / Ask AI already exist
  as actions in the Dock; reuse those; list any that don't exist in the PR and ask before building them.
- Strip auto-sizes; unpin from the pill's context menu; order is the user's (drag) or pin order.
- Actions that are destructive/outbound keep their consent step even when pinned.
- Tests: pin/unpin per app, strip order, a pinned destructive action still asks, overflow.
End with the AGENTS.md hand-off.
```

**5. Then** the inventory's own order: keyboard rules (B/C/E4) into a shared tested type →
remaining scopes → owner decisions D9 / D11 / D12.

## Owner decisions (append-only)

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-24 | Name: **General Chat** everywhere, never "AI Assistant". |
| 2026-09-24 | Priority: move the ⌥⌥ Dock into the Corner with exactly the same behaviour, functions and navigation. |
| 2026-09-24 | Swipes in the Corner: exactly the Dock's, horizontal and vertical, over the input only (`00-DOCK-AND-CORNER.md` §4b). |
| 2026-09-24 | Selection actions + swipes are one task (`corner-parity`). |
| 2026-09-24 | Global Context lives on the ⌘⌘ row; no separate hotkey row. |
| 2026-09-25 | Selection in the Corner: **B** — reuse the Dock's rows through a bridge now, extract later. Conditions: (1) behind a `SelectionActionProviding` protocol, the Corner never names LauncherView; (2) works cold, before ⌥⌥ was ever opened (verified: LauncherView is built at launch); (3) Corner-side tests for rows, order, close button, Esc; (4) GitHub issue "Extract SelectionActionSource out of LauncherView", must land before the Dock retires. |
| 2026-09-25 | Selection AI rows (Ask AI, presets) run through the Corner's own ask path; the prompt lives only in `DockPill.selectionAIPrompt`, which the Dock also reads. |
| 2026-09-25 | Selection Share rows left out of the Corner for now; D10 stays 🟡 ("Share missing") until they return. |
| 2026-09-25 | The Corner captures the selection when it builds its list and runs every row on that copy, never on the live Dock payload. |
| 2026-09-25 | New bug-fix sessions wait until the Selection PR merges. |
| 2026-09-25 | Replaces "Share left out": the Selection card does everything the Dock's Selection does **inside one panel** — answers (never a second card), Share (the app's own share routes: native destinations, typed "send to …"), file preview, all extensions. D10 → ✅ when these ship. |
| 2026-09-25 | AX-driven work (menus, Writing Tools, writing into another app) runs only with Computer Use on for that app; otherwise the user's AI provider does it (surface-cost spec). |
| 2026-09-25 | Quick Note: a Save-to-Quick-Note action on answers; the knowledge graph gets no action. |
| 2026-09-25 | Test sends go only to the owner (Gokula Kannan J). |
| 2026-09-25 | Selection test matrix: Safari is checked like the other apps, not in depth. |
| 2026-09-25 | The Context Dock (frontmost-app chat) folds its field away at rest into a bar of the app's own things — pinned actions, open tabs, pinned tabs — like Global Context's running apps; not Global's pins. Open tabs in #89; pins are task 5. |
| 2026-09-25 | ⌥⌥ opens the **Dock**, ⌘⌘ opens the **Corner** — fixed, no setting. Task 3 ("⌥⌥ opens Dock / Corner" setting) is dropped. |
| 2026-09-25 | Chat Window hotkey stays **⌃C** (advised ⌃⌥C). Known cost: a global hotkey takes the key from every app, so ⌃C no longer interrupts a running command in Terminal (or reaches any other app) while DoraX runs. Revisit if that bites. |
| 2026-09-25 | Safari tabs show as **pills in the Corner's strip next to the input**, like the Dock's tab strip — not as rows in the result list. The strip auto-sizes. |
| 2026-09-25 | The Corner's strip holds the user's **pins per app**: tabs, menu commands, app actions (e.g. Safari: Add to Bookmarks, Export as PDF, Save as Markdown, Ask AI) and the user's own actions. |

## Open decisions (owner)

- What ⌥⌥ opens once the Dock retires (A1 end state). Until then: ⌥⌥ Dock, ⌘⌘ Corner (2026-09-25).
- D9 Notifications, D11 Quick Note editor, D12 Mail in the Corner: move, or drop from v1?
